# Design Interview Challenge: Galactic Travels

Welcome, Candidate!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to redesign this humble "Galactic Travels" website into a **futuristic, mind-blowing experience**.

## The Theme
**"Futuristic Space Travel Agency"**
Imagine a world where booking a trip to Mars is as easy as booking a flight to New York. We want you to sell the dream of interplanetary travel.

**Keywords**: Sci-Fi, Neon, Holographic, Immersive, Luxury, speed.

## The Task
Design and implement TWO pages:
1.  **Landing Page (`/`)**:
    - Hook the user immediately.
    - Show off why they should travel with us.
    - Include a "Book Your Trip" Call-to-Action.
2.  **Destination Details Page (`/destination/:id`)**:
    - Show details for a specific planet (e.g., Mars).
    - Display Price, Travel Time (e.g., "3 days via Hyper-Warp"), and a brief Itinerary.
    - Make the user feel like they are already there.

## Styling & Tools
- You are free to use **ANY** styling method you prefer (CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, SASS, etc.).
- `react-three-fiber` is pre-installed.
- `react-router-dom` is set up for navigation.

## Bonus Challenge (Optional but Cool)
Use **Three.js** to add 3D elements to the page.
- Ideas: A rotating interactive planet, a starry background, a flying ship.
- Use the pre-installed `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` libraries.

## Constraints
- **Responsiveness**: It should look good on desktop and mobile.
- **Creativity**: We value unique interactions and "crazy" ideas over standard corporate design.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable code is appreciated.

## Getting Started
1.  `npm install`
2.  `npm run dev`

Good luck, and see you on the other side of the galaxy!
